# Portfolio Gallery

The purpose of this project is to build a plugin that makes it a lot easier to manage galleries in the backend of WordPress while also making a cool way to display the photos.

This plugin adds a custom post type called galleries. These galleries will hold different types of images such as landscapes, portraits, macros, and black and white photographs.

The plugin will also display the galleries into 3d CSS boxes that can then be opened to a carousel display.

This plugin is built ontop of the WordPress Plugin boilerplate from [wppb.io](http://www.wppb.io)
